# Hi, Gomoku!

This project is a competitive project in course [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/DATA130008/index.html).

The Gomoku AIs are based on the Gomocup standard and you can create your own `AI.exe` through `pisqpipe`, the materials and document are [here](https://github.com/zhangshun97/AI_Gomocup/tree/master/pisqpipe).

## Our team

We have three amazing guys here, [Shun Zhang](https://github.com/zhangshun97), [Donghao Li](https://github.com/Lidonghao1996) and [Pingxuan Huang](https://github.com/Explorerhpx).

- The Genetic Algorithm is supported by Pingxuan.
- The VCX Algorithm is supported by Donghao.
- The MCTS Algorithm and Minimax Algorithm are supported by me.

## Realized Algorithms

- Monte-Carlo Tree Search
- Genetic Algorithm
- Minimax Search
  - VCX
  - Alpha-beta pruning
  - Zobrist transition table
  - dinamic updating with pattern score
